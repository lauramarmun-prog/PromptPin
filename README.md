# PromptPin

A calm, local-first prompt + image album.

## Installation (Netlify – no coding required)

### Step 1 — Download the files

Go to the GitHub repo:  
https://github.com/lauramarmun-prog/PromptPin

Click **Code → Download ZIP**  
Remember where you downloaded it  
Unzip the file  
You’ll get a folder like `PromptPin`

---

### Step 2 — Upload to Netlify

Go to https://www.netlify.com/ and create a free account  
Open **Sites**  
Drag & drop the unzipped folder (`PromptPin`) into the upload area  
Wait a few seconds… your website will be live

---

### Step 3 — Your website

Your site URL will look like:  
`https://something-random.netlify.app/`

You can bookmark it and start using PromptPin right away.

---

## Troubleshooting

❌ Blank page or error?  
→ Make sure you uploaded the unzipped folder, not the ZIP file.

❌ App doesn’t load?  
→ Check that the folder contains an `index.html` file.

## Future ideas (optional)

PromptPin is intentionally simple.  
If there’s enough interest, future versions may include optional cloud sync — but for now, local comes first.

---

## Made with care

This project was created to be calm, accessible, and friendly — especially for non-technical users.
